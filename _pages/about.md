It feels good to see you here!

I'm at the University of California San Diego, studying CS & AI.

Previously, I've worked as an AI researcher at MIDAS IIIT-Delhi, advised by Dr. Rajiv Ratn Shah (CS PhD, NUS Singapore), where I designed novel algorithms for neural quantitative trading and natural language processing.

Before that, I was with the Indian government & built AI systems at their Intelligent Systems Group, where my work now potentially impacts over a million people across India.

Over the past couple of years, I've had the fortune to work/collaborate with some of the brightest minds at CSIR (Govt. of India), IIIT-Delhi, Tower Research, NVIDIA, Samsung, LG Soft, ISRO, IIT-Jodhpur, MIT, Hiroshima University, and Vanderbilt University.

Academically, I hold a Bachelor of Technology degree with a major in Information Technology (Applied CS) from GGSIPU, India, where the department honored me as one of their best students.

When I'm not working, I like to travel, play the bass, design graphics, or replicate EDITH.
